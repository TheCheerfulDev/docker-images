# ELK (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana)
This docker repo contains a complete ELK stack. To ingest logging into logstash, i would advice using one of the [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) provided by elastic.co.

Kafka and Zookeeper are supplied in the docker-compose.yml, but they are commented out.
